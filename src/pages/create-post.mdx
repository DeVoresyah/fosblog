## Writing Post

### Thumbnail

### Title & Filename

You can use any format for the title, but for filename you must follow rules:

- lowercase
- kebab case
- no special character

you can use this script if you need help generating filename based on your post title

```javascript
function generateFilename(title) {
  return string
    .toString()
    .trim()
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '')
    .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-')
    .replace(/^-+/, '')
    .replace(/-+$/, '');
}

generateFilename("<your-title-here>");
```
